🚀 Hi there! I'm PL, a web developer turned entrepreneur. In just a year, I've transformed my dreams into digital realities.

⌛ Before embarking on my entrepreneurial journey, I honed my skills as a full-stack web developer at renowned companies including Melba, Ouicar, and Photobox.

🔥 Entrepreneurial Journey: Left my 9-5 job a year ago and haven't looked back. It's been a journey of growth, learning, and lots of coding! [Dunniabs](https://dunniabs.com))

🌐 Exciting Projects: Proud to have created four websites from scratch:

Two for Gnogen ([Great-war](https://gng.gnogen.io) and [Gnogons](https://gnogons.gnogen.io)), leveraging MultiversX.
The stylish [RizenCity](https://rizencity.io) website.
And my biggest project, [Reboom](https://reboom.co).

💡 Tech Stack: Thanks to NextJS, Vercel, trpc.io, and Shadcn UI, I've achieved a quality I always aspired to. A big shoutout to all OSS contributors who made this possible!

📢 Future Talks: Stay tuned as I share insights on Reboom's journey and how our tech stack streamlined our product delivery.

🙏 Gratitude: A huge thanks to the developer and entrepreneur communities for the daily dose of inspiration and knowledge.
